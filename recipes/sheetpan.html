            <h1>Sheet Pan Salmon And Crispy Rice</h1>
            <p><b>Sheet pan dinners</b> are the ultimate solution to quick and easy one-pan meals. In this salmon version, leftover rice is crisped up with scallions, capers, and lemon juice on a hot sheet pan before it’s topped with salmon with a mustard and brown sugar glaze.</p>
           <p><i>Asparagus</i> roasted alongside the salmon makes this a complete meal that only takes 20 minutes of hands-on time. A sprinkle of feta and herbs at the end adds a bit of saltiness and brightness, which pulls the whole dish together. Serve this meal directly from the sheet pan for easy clean up. </p>
           <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup neutral cooking oil (such as grapeseed oil or canola oil)</li>
            <li>6 cups leftover rice (white or brown)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced scallions (about 5 scallions) </li>
            <li>1/4 cup drained non-pareil capers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon, plus a pinch of black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-in. pieces</li>
            <li>4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped mixed tender herbs, such as dill, parsley, basil, and tarragon</li>
           </ul>
            <h3>Steps: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour neutral oil on a rimmed baking sheet, and place on lower rack of oven. Preheat oven to 450°F.</li>
                <li>Stir together rice, scallions, capers, and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a large bowl. Whisk together lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl; stir half of lemon juice mixture into rice mixture. Carefully remove baking sheet from oven, and spread rice mixture on baking sheet in an even layer. Bake rice mixture on lower rack of oven at 450°F until rice is lightly browned and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk mustard and brown sugar into remaining lemon juice mixture in small bowl; set mustard sauce aside. Sprinkle salmon evenly with pepper and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
                <li>Remove baking sheet from oven. Place salmon over rice, skin side down. Spoon mustard sauce evenly over salmon. Toss asparagus with a drizzle of olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Scatter asparagus around salmon. Return baking sheet to oven, and bake at 450°F until salmon is lightly browned on top and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, depending on thickness of fillets.</li>
                <li>Divide rice, salmon, and asparagus among 4 plates. Top evenly with feta and herbs. Serve immediately.</li>
