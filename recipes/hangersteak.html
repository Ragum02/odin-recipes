        <h1>Hanger Steak with Romesco</h1>
        <p>Inspired by a dish at Cúrate in Asheville, North Carolina, this smoky and sweet yellow squash romesco sauce showcases peak-season produce.</p>
        <p>Made with charred summer squash and <em>bell pepper</em>, salted smoked almonds, sherry vinegar, and spices, it’s packed with complexity and depth. Salt the sliced squash prior to grilling to extract moisture for a deeper, more concentrated flavor. The romesco is a perfect partner for beefy hanger steak and a side of roasted potatoes and grilled squash.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 yellow squash (about 8 ounces each), divided</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for grill</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds hanger steak</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted smoked almonds, plus more chopped for garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a gas grill to medium-high (400°F to 450°F). Cut 2 squash in half lengthwise, and toss with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; set aside. Cut remaining 1 squash on an angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place squash slices in a single layer on a paper towel–lined baking sheet; sprinkle both sides evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toss bell pepper with 1/2 tablespoon oil; grill, uncovered, turning often, until charred all over, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer bell pepper to a large heatproof bowl, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand for 10 minutes. Peel off charred bell pepper skin using a paper towel; discard skin, seeds, and any juices in bowl. Set aside. Do not turn off grill.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from refrigerator; let stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pat salted squash slices dry with paper towels. Place squash slices and squash halves on oiled grates; grill, uncovered, turning once, until slices are charred on both sides and halves are tender, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer squash slices to a blender. Set aside squash halves. Increase grill heat to high (450°F to 500°F).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steak with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Grill steak, uncovered, turning once, until charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 125°F for medium-rare, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add bell pepper, almonds, paprika, coriander, turmeric, 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1 teaspoon salt to blender with squash slices. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside romesco.</li>
            <li>Whisk together parsley, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Roughly chop squash halves, and toss with dressing in bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice steak, and serve with romesco and squash salad. Garnish with chopped smoked almonds.</li>
